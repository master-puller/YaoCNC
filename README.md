# YaoCNC
Yet another Open Source CNC. Designed to be fully parametric, configurable and self-upgrading (Machine upgrades for itself).

Many small starter CNC machined are severely limited in what they can do, and are closed-source. True open-source CNCs are also of a much larger and more expensive bill of materials, often costing thousands of dollars to complete. They are unsuitable for beginners.

This project aims to solve both of these issues by providing a CNC that can be configured to the materials and tools available on-hand.
